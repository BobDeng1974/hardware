Cell phone 3.5 to 2.5mm adapter
===============================

This adapter can be used to feed audio from a sound system into a 2.5mm headphone jack
on a cell phone.  

Some cell phones detect a headset by sensing the microphone resistance, so a 
simple resistor is added on the MIC input to simulate this.

Schematic is in KiCad format.
